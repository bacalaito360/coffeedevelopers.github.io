Water temperature plays a crucial role in extracting the desired flavors from your coffee beans, and the ideal temperature varies depending on the roast level you're using for your pour-over brew. Here's a deeper dive into the relationship between the two:

| Roast Level | Ideal Water Temperature Range | Recommended Brewing Time |
|---|---|---|
| Light | 195°F - 203°F (90°C - 95°C) | 2:30 - 3:00 minutes |
| Medium | 200°F - 205°F (93°C - 96°C) | 2:15 - 2:45 minutes |
| Dark | 190°F - 200°F (88°C - 93°C) | 2:00 - 2:30 minutes |

### **Light Roasts:**

Desired flavor profile: Lighter roasts are known for their bright acidity, delicate floral notes, and subtle sweetness.
Ideal water temperature: 203°F - 205°F (95°C - 96°C). Their denser cell structure requires higher water temperatures to release their delicate flavors and achieve desirable extraction levels.  Note that overextraction may occur with light roasts even though the requirements are higher temperatures.  Make sure to experiment and adjust based on preference!

### **Medium Roasts:**

Desired flavor profile: Medium roasts offer a balance between the acidity of lighter roasts and the bolder flavors of dark roasts, showcasing a wider range of fruity and nutty notes.
Ideal water temperature: 200°F - 203°F (93°C - 95°C). This slightly higher temperature allows for more complete extraction while still maintaining some of the brightness and complexity of the roast.

### **Dark Roasts:**

Desired flavor profile: Dark roasts are bolder and richer, with less acidity and more pronounced chocolatey, smoky, and caramelized notes.
Ideal water temperature: 195°F - 200°F (90°C - 93°C). Using high water temperatures would lead to over-extraction, resulting in bitterness and harshness.

### **Additional Factors:**

* **Personal preference:** Ultimately, the optimal water temperature is a matter of personal taste. Again: experiment within the suggested ranges and adjust based on your preferences for a brighter or bolder cup.
* **Grind size:** A finer grind requires a slightly lower water temperature for balanced extraction, while a coarser grind can handle a slightly higher temperature.
* **Bean origin:** Different origins can have slightly different flavor profiles, so you might need to adjust the temperature slightly to highlight specific characteristics.
